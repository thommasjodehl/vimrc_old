#My vimrc config

This is my personal vimrc settings. You may steal all you want
from this repo.

On first time setup(in Windows), remember to install git and curl as
described in the Vundle repo on github and follow the
installation procedure of Vundle in general.

To install Ag properly, the search engine "The Silver Searcher"
must be installed. See the github repo for the "The Silver Searcher"
on how to install on Windows.

For Ag installation, see the Ag github repo.

TODO: Update this file more often.

TODO: Instead of committing the plugin folders, they should be implemented as submodules.
